# ToggleLEDWithButton
---------------------
This is a simple project with the STM32F407G (DISC1) microcontroller, which I had done for the purposes of learning embedded development.  

### Description
When the User button on the microcontroller is pressed, all four of the LED lights will turn on. As soon as the button is released, the LED lights will be turned off.
The current iteration of the project uses the provided high-level driver APIs. In the future, I plan on implementing the same logic without the use of these APIs.
