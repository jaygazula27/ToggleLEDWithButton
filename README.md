# ToggleLEDWithButton
---------------------
This is a simple project with the STM32F407G (DISC1) microcontroller, which I had done for the purposes of learning embedded development. 
There is usage of the HAL APIs. However, similar functionality was implemented in my other [repository](https://github.com/jaygazula27/ToggleLEDWithButton-NoHAL), which did not use the HAL APIs.

### Description
When the User button on the microcontroller is pressed, all four of the LED lights will turn on. As soon as the button is released, the LED lights will be turned off.

### Resources
- [STM32CubeMX](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) - To generate the initialization code.
